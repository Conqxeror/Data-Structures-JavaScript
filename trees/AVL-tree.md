# AVL Tree in JavaScript

An AVL Tree (Adelson-Velsky and Landis Tree) is a self-balancing binary search tree (BST) in which the heights of the two child subtrees of every node differ by at most one. AVL Trees are designed to maintain their balance during insertions and deletions, ensuring that search operations remain efficient.

## Operations on AVL Trees

Common operations on AVL Trees include:

- **Insertion**: Adding a new value to the AVL Tree while rebalancing if necessary.
- **Deletion**: Removing a node with a specific value from the AVL Tree while rebalancing.
- **Searching**: Finding a node with a specific value in the AVL Tree.
- **Traversal**: Visiting nodes in a specific order (in-order, pre-order, or post-order).

## Advantages of AVL Trees

- Self-balancing: AVL Trees automatically maintain their balance, ensuring logarithmic height.
- Efficient searching: Search operations are efficient due to the balanced structure.
- Predictable performance: AVL Trees provide predictable performance for all operations.

## JavaScript Implementation

In JavaScript, you can implement an AVL Tree using classes and objects. Here's an example of implementing a basic AVL Tree:

```js
class TreeNode {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.left = null;
    this.right = null;
    this.height = 1; // Initial height of a new node is 1
  }
}

class AVLTree {
  constructor() {
    this.root = null;
  }

  // Insert a new value into the AVL Tree while maintaining balance
  insert(value) {
    const newNode = new TreeNode(value);
    if (!this.root) {
      this.root = newNode;
    } else {
      this.root = this._insertNode(this.root, newNode);
    }
  }

  _insertNode(node, newNode) {
    // Insert the new node and update heights
    // Balance the tree if necessary
    // ...
  }

  // Other methods like search, traversal, and deletion can be implemented here
}

// Usage example
const avlTree = new AVLTree();
avlTree.insert(5);
avlTree.insert(3);
avlTree.insert(7);
```
